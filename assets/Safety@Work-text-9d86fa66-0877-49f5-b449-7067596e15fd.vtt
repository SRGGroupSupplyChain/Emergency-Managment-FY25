00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:05.291
Beeping

2
00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.825
Did you hear that? Oh no! We better hide!

3
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:16.583
An alert tone is used to signal there may
be a possible problem that wardens are currently investigating.

4
00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:17.494
An alert tone is used to signal there may
be a possible problem that wardens are currently investigating.

5
00:00:17.494 --> 00:00:22.935
We need to remain in an alert condition,
wait for another set of instructions and stay in this area.

6
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:28.461
Let me see if there are any customers,
visitors or vulnerable persons that might need assistance

7
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.781
should we need to evacuate.

8
00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:33.748
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

9
00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:37.808
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

10
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:38.333
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

11
00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:43.333
That sounded different. What do we do now?

12
00:00:43.708 --> 00:00:46.948
That is the evacuation tone to signal we
need to evacuate.

13
00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:47.948
Don't worry.

14
00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:50.508
Our sites all have a designated assembly
point.

15
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.041
Let's take the closest exit and go to the
assembly point area

16
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.319
Let's take the closest exit and go to the
assembly point area

17
00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.375
at the furthermost point of the car park.

18
00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:02.447
We can now safely wait and follow
instructions from the Chief Warden or Emergency Service personnel.

19
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.880
Remember, evacuation drills should be
practised yearly

20
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.039
in Australia or every six months in New
Zealand.

21
00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.859
Upon hearing the evacuation tone or alert
signal,

22
00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:13.960
you need to take the appropriate action.

23
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.840
Ask your manager to explain the alarms

24
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.500
as different sites have different alarms
in place.

25
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.760
Remain calm and do not run.

26
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.440
When instructed, leave the building
immediately

27
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.559
and check the room you are leaving is
empty.

28
00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:27.360
Do not take personal belongings

29
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.760
and do not use elevators or lifts.

30
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.280
Go to the designated assembly areas.

31
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.680
If you are unsure, ask the Person in
Charge (PiC)

32
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.979
where your site's assembly point is
located

33
00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.139
and listen for and follow instructions

34
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.180
from the Chief Warden or emergency service
personnel.

35
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.900
Do not re-enter a building or leave the
assembly area

36
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.459
until you are told to do so.
